- remember folder position when adding songs (takes time as adding a song and going one folder up for next song jumps to top of folder)
- when saving a playlist, the default path seems invalid, so playlist doesn's save, and no error given
- for some reasom, one folder shows 0 files, but filled with mp3 files (?)

Fixed:
+ context menu event outside of musicTable causes crash
+ cancel add folder, add url causes crash
+ doesn't remember add folder folder
+ adding some files can cause a crash ("Blessing, Compassion")
+ bold-italic highlight does not move on normal track switch (when one ends and the next starts)
+ quick next-next while playing stops playback
+ meta info display mismatch (title duplication, some files receive some other file's meta info instead of their ("reality")) (might be related to previous)
