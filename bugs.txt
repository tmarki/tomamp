- meta info display mismatch (title duplication, some files receive some other file's meta info instead of their ("reality")) (might be related to previous)
- quick next-next while playing stops playback
- bold-italic highlight does not move on normal track switch (when one ends and the next starts)

Fixed:
+ context menu event outside of musicTable causes crash
+ cancel add folder, add url causes crash
+ doesn't remember add folder folder
+ adding some files can cause a crash ("Blessing, Compassion")
